#Vaidyalikit: 

This project is actually a modification of the Tensorflow Flower Recognition with Android Tutorial(description below).

The app was developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2022 for the following problem statement:

Solution to digitize the handwritten prescriptions, doctor notes, lab reports, which can also help to integrate tightly with other healthcare systems for seamless digitization and data flow. Standardized forms can also be made machine readable with support for multiple local Indian languages to make digitization much simpler.

Instead of flowers we added the handwritten names of five medicines: Ostocal-D, Nappa, Neuro-B, Maxpro, Ranitid.

# Recogonize Flowers with TensorFLow Lite Model Maker and Android Studio ML Model Binding

This folder contains the code for the TensorFlow Lite codelab:

* [Recognize Flowers with TensorFlow on Android (Beta)](https://goo.gle/3dbCSbt)

## Introduction

This beta codelab introduces the latest tooling using TensorFlow Lite Model Maker and Android Studio 4.1 Beta 1 or above. In addition, it will require access to a physical Android device to test. If you prefer to use the stable version of this codelab, follow this codelab instead.

In these codelabs, you will learn:

*   How to train your own custom image classifier using [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/tutorials/model_maker_image_classification).
*   How to use Android Studio to import the TensorFlow Lite model to integrate the custom model in an Android app using CameraX.
*   How to use GPU on your phone to accelerate your model.


## Pre-requisites

[Android Studio 4.1 Beta 1 or above](http://developers.android.com/studio/preview)

## Getting Started

Visit the Google codelabs site to follow along the guided steps.
